An example of this is when a science teacher assigns a cell packet project which corresponds to the cell unit taught during school. This might be very boring for a student to learn, but doing this project will set the student up for success when school begins. If the student were to design their own project it would probably not be in line with the certain style of teaching which will cause the student to struggle during the school year.
